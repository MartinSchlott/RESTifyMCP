# RESTifyMCP V03 Enhancement Plan

This directory contains instructions for implementing the next version (V03) of RESTifyMCP, focusing on two major enhancements:

## Enhancement Goals

1. **Multi-MCP-Server Client Support**: Allow a single client to connect to multiple MCP servers and aggregate their tools
2. **Enhanced Combo Mode**: Support multiple client connections in combo mode while maintaining the built-in client

## Implementation Documents

The implementation is broken down into two main documents:

1. [01_multi_mcp_server_client.md](01_multi_mcp_server_client.md)
   - New data structures for multi-server configuration
   - MCPManager implementation for managing multiple MCP servers
   - Tool aggregation and conflict handling
   - Integration with existing client architecture

2. [02_enhanced_combo_mode.md](02_enhanced_combo_mode.md)
   - Refactoring the combo mode to support multiple clients
   - Enhanced WebSocket server implementation
   - Configuration examples for combo mode
   - External client connection workflow

## Implementation Order

For optimal development flow, implement these enhancements in the following order:

1. Start with the Multi-MCP-Server Client support
   - Update type definitions
   - Implement the MCPManager
   - Modify the RESTifyClient

2. Then implement the Enhanced Combo Mode
   - Refactor the WSServer
   - Update the RESTifyServer
   - Enhance the RESTifyCombo class
   - Update configuration validation

## Backward Compatibility

No backward compatibility is required for these enhancements. The new version will use a new configuration format that supports the enhanced functionality.

## Testing Strategy

After implementation, test the following scenarios:

1. Single client with multiple MCP servers
2. Combo mode with built-in multi-server client
3. Combo mode with additional external clients
4. Tool invocation across different clients and servers

## Dependencies

This implementation relies on the existing code structure of RESTifyMCP V02, particularly:
- WebSocket client/server implementation
- API Spaces architecture
- Tool invocation workflow

Refer to the V02 codebase for the foundational architecture upon which these enhancements will be built.
